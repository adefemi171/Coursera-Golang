// Explain what the race condition is and how it can occur.
/**
When two or more goroutines have unsynchronized access to a shared resource and 
attempt to read and write to that resource at the same time, you have whatâ€™s called a race condition. 
Race conditions are the reason concurrent programming is complicated and has a greater potential for bugs. 
Read and write operations against a shared resource must always be atomic, 
or in other words, done by only one goroutine at a time.
